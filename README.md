# How to run the backend server
The back end consists of a database with information on the clients, the employees, the products for sale and the orders made via the app.

To run it, simply acess the local terminal on the automacorp folder using IntelliJ and run the command

    .\gradlew bootRun

While it's executing, it's connected to the frontend. You can open the webpages and they should be getting the data from the API.

The application is also hosted at the CleverCloud and accessible through the links:
